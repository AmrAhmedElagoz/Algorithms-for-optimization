# An overview of Taylor series as approximations of functions

We care about Taylor series because they allow us to approximate other functions in predictable ways. Sometimes, these approximations can be made to be very, very, very accurate without requiring too much computing power.

You might have heard that computers/calculators routinely use Taylor series to calculate things like $e^x$ (which is more or less often true)
